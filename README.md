# VoxelizeGeometry 
## A.K.A. Cube-a-Saurus

**Cube-a-Saurus** provides tools to voxelize 3D geometries into uniformly sized cubic Breps (voxels) and evaluate their spatial relationship with reference geometries and points. The component is ideal for applications in 3D modeling, architecture, computational design, and manufacturing, where discrete representations of complex geometries are needed.

This work is an ongoing PhD research project at the University of Michigan. This component was initially used to translate FEA load data to color-informed voxels that were then converted into 3D printing toolpaths.
